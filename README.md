# 06-code-quiz

## Description

This repo contains all files related to the week 6 challenge. I was motivated to build the code quiz because I wanted to further practice applying JavaScript. The website allows users to test their JavaScript knowledge through a series of questions and provides instant feedback over their response. The user receives a score at the end of the quiz to show how well they have performed. I found this project challenging, but it enabled me to practice using event listeners, local storage and setting up a countdown using the set interval method.
